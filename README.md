`swipe_deck` is a Flutter package for a Tinder Card Swiper. âœ¨

It allows swiping in all directions with any widget as a card.

Very smooth animations supporting Android, iOS & WebApp.

## Features

### Trigger swipe up and swipe down through controller

You can now trigger swipe up and swipe down with our `SwipeDeckController` regardless of the chosen `SwipeDirection` (which is still used when `swipe` is called through the controller). Just like the swipeLeft and swipeRight call, you can call `swipeUp` or `swipeDown` through the controller anywhere you want.

### Restrict horizontal or vertical swipe

You can now restrict the swipe in either horizontal directions or vertical directions using `swipeOptions` property.

### Set looping for card swipe

Now you can set the `loop` property to `true` and make the list infinitely scrollable.

### Update the cards while swiping

In this version we have replaced the list of cards with `cardsBuilder`. Now the widget only renders two cards at a time which makes it lightweight and scalable. So you can perform operations on your card anytime.

## Installation

Create a new project with the command

```yaml
flutter create MyApp
```

Add

```yaml
swipe_deck: ...
```

to your `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project.
**OR**
run

```yaml
flutter pub add swipe_deck
```

in your project's root directory.

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:swipe_deck/swipe_deck.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Usage

You can place your `SwipeDeck` inside of a `Scaffold` or `CupertinoPageScaffold` like we did here. Optional parameters can be defined to enable different features. See the following example..

```dart
import 'package:swipe_deck/swipe_deck.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';

class Example extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      child: SizedBox(
        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.75,
        child: SwipeDeck(
          cardsCount: 10,
          cardsBuilder: (BuildContext context,int index){
            return Container(
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: const Text(index.toString()),
              color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Controller

The `Controller` is used to control the `swipe`, `swipeLeft`, `swipeRight`, `swipeUp`, `swipeDown` or `unswipe` function of the swiper from outside of the widget. You can create a controller called `SwipeDeckController` and save the instance for further usage. Please have a closer look to our Example for the usage.

| Method     | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| swipe      | Changes the state of the controller to swipe and swipes the card in your selected direction.       |
| swipeLeft  | Changes the state of the controller to swipe left and swipes the card to the left side.            |
| swipeRight | Changes the state of the controller to swipe right and swipes the card to the right side.          |
| swipeUp    | Changes the state of the controller to swipe up and swipes the card to the up side.                |
| swipeDown  | Changes the state of the controller to swipe down and swipes the card to the down side.            |
| unswipe    | Changes the state of the controller to unswipe and brings back the last card that was swiped away. |
